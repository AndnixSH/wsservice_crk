v1.0.0

First release

v1.0.1

[install procedure]
 Added restart of all services in the group "LocalServiceAndNoImpersonation".
 It is required to restart svchost.exe because svchost read service list from the registry only once
  at the start of the first service in the group.
 Without this measure installer gives error on clean systems.

v1.1.0
 Digital signature checking bypass in WSServiceCrk.
 Added WinStoreInterceptor - first release.

v1.1.1
 Some dangerous bugs in api hooking - could lead to crash.
 Change to wsservice.dll appearance checking algorithm.
 Installer automatically disables some critical scheduled tasks :
  schtasks /change /disable /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\WS\License Validation"
  schtasks /change /disable /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\WS\WSRefreshBannedAppsListTask"

v1.2.0
 Apps loading process reimagined. WinStoreInterceptor removed as obsolete.
 Added wsll - Windows Store License Loader.
 Added xmlsign - a tool for bogus-signing licenses.
 WSServiceCrk unattended installation options : "inst","uninst".

1.2.1
 Installer rewritten without MFC. EXE size reduced from 4 Mb to 200 kb.
 Installer now checks version of installed wsservice_crk.dll.
  Installation of older versions is blocked.
 Added license uninstallation to wsll.
 New tool for analyzing tokens.dat - TokenExtractor.

1.2.2
 TokenExtractor can now avoid crap in tokens.dat - it will not fall with error.
  Crap is actually remnants of uninstalled licenses - WSService does not zero file area occupied by license xml.
 TokenExtractor can now save original licenses. You can backup them, reinstall windows, deploy appx and wsll license.
  No WSServiceCrk is required since license has valid microsoft signature.

1.2.3
 In some cases BCryptVerifySignature returns STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER. I dont know why - may be something about crypto math.
  WSServiceCrk now also converts STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER to STATUS_SUCCESS.
 Added easy to use function in TokenExtractor "CrackIt".
 TokenExtractor now shows license type in the list.
 WSServiceCrk 32 bit installer now refuses to run on x64 systems.

1.2.4
 Updated docs for downloading of appx from windows store. Fiddler is not needed anymore.
 Appx URL grabbing and appx downloading added to TokenExtractor.
 TokenExtractor can now install license from a file.

1.2.5
 Wsll and TokenExtractor(CrackIt) now try installing test license first in
  order not to screw existing license if something is not working (for example
  WSServiceCrk is not running or not functional).
 Added license uninstallation to TokenExtractor.
 Added "Refresh" button to TokenExtractor.
 Added noob's readme.

1.2.6
 WSServiceCrk : secure modification of import pointers.
 Added ProductPolicyEditor. It can be used to enable sideloading on any
  edition of Windows 8,

1.2.7
 Updated winjs.appx dependency.
 Updated ProductPolicyEditor to 1.0.3 (some serious bugs were there).
 Token extractor : added cleanup of winstore error 0x8024600e. Added problem description : info/StoreWUAuth.txt.

1.2.8
 TokenExtractor : license list retrieval now uses WSClient API and shows really installed licenses as seen by WSService.
  Tokens.dat bruteforce option left as button.
 wsll : added "-l" option (Show license list).

1.2.9
 TokenExtractor : fixed minor error in license parsing. Some licenses are 
  stored with unknown binary prefix. It must be skipped.

1.3.0
 TokenExtractor & wsll : added UTF-8 conversion of licenses XMLs coming from
  WS client API.
 wsll : new options : -u (uninstall license), -n (do not perform bogus license test).

1.4.0
 Breaking WARBIRD code made it possible to enable sideloading on any edition of windows without disabling sppsvc and using ProductPolicyEditor.

1.4.1
 Some code refactorings :
  Warbird error handling rewritten with exceptions. Tons of ifs gone. Code is easily readable.
  Hooking/unhooking API in wsservice_crk uses defines. Repeating code fragments gone.
 Verbose DbgLogging : hexdumping of NtSetSystemInformation(134) and stringdumping of BCryptHashData.
 Added warbird query format description and sample captures.

1.4.2
 Further wsservice code optimization.
 Fixed importang bug in warbird code. Bug could result in invalid encryption/decryption.
 Warbird code : added support for comfortable artificial calling of NtSetSystemInformation(134).
 More precise info about warbird PolicyValueQuery chunk format.
 Fixed anchoring of some buttons in TokenExtractor.
 TokenExtractor : added text search capability.
