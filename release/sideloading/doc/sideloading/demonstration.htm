<H2>Windows 8/2012 Windows Store Service crack</H2>

Imagine you want to deploy self-signed (may be repacked) appx.
You run powershell :
<BR><BR>

<BR>Then you switch to metro start screen and attempt to launch application<BR><BR>

<img src="2.jpg"><BR>

<BR>Whoops ! Error. This is probably because windows do not allow sideloading of metro applications.
I assume you are smart guy and made the appx right, signed it and imported code signing cert into local machine's Trusted Root certificate store.
Also you set the following policy key : <BR>
<P>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Appx]<BR>
"AllowAllTrustedApps"=dword:00000001
</P>

Now let's start Windows Store cracking service.<BR><BR>

<img src="3.jpg"><BR>

<BR>To monitor cracking service activity launch DbgView from sysinternals<BR><BR>

<img src="4.jpg"><BR>

<BR>Let's deploy our appx again<BR><BR>

<img src="5.jpg"><BR>

<BR>Here is DbgView output<BR><BR>

<img src="6.jpg"><BR>

<BR>Now launch application again<BR><BR>

<img src="7.jpg"><BR>

<BR>It worked now ! This is because cracking service fakes Windows Store service to think that it is running on domain joined machine.
Microsoft allows sideloading either on domain machines or on machines having special sideloading product key installed.
May be once those keys will be available to public, but now here is my solution to the problem.
Also machines having developer license are allowed to run unsigned metro applications. But this license expires every month and
Microsoft promises to monitor developers activity to fight piracy and other abuse.

Enjoy !<BR><BR>
