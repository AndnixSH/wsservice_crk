This package is intended for educational purposes.
It is created to demonstrate that WinRT platform is not only about Windows Store.
By using this crack you can bypass DRM and unlock most of windows store apps.
You can also create redistributable packages.

Using and redistributing paid content is TOTALLY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
In no case author should take any liability.

I neither encourage or discourage you to do that. It's up to your choice and
philosophy. I respect some concerns from copyright owners.
But more than that I respect people's freedom of choice and disrespect
any attempts to limit it for big money's sake - bigger than any single person
can consume. Also I disrespect the idea of DRM-locking computing environment
where nothing can be done without permission of the "big brother".
I hate when serving innovation and everyone's good is substituted
by serving money. I believe this is what have been done by microsoft.
They are forcing users to adopt their new metro experience.
Not because its innovative - it is not. It's step back in technology.
The whole idea of immersive UI was initially about tablets and phones - not
desktop. MS do not have any significant part in tablet sales but they
have in desktop. It was quite logical for them to do something with
desktop to change everyone's mind how computer should look, feel and behave.
I would respect them if they did that as an option. But they are forcing.
Because otherwise nobody would use their crap called Metro UI on desktop
and will never start buying win8 tablets.
In desktop part they have taken away some nice features from Aero UI. It was also done
to make metro look better. They have taken away desktop start menu to force
users look at Metro any time user need to start a program.
Everything is intended to put single idea into user's head :
Metro is MAIN UI. That's how windows now looks. Metro is windows itself !
They want to force everyone to buy software only from their store and have their 30%.
Because it once can become much bigger than all windows sales.
So, I believe windows 8 was not intended to serve people - people were
intended to serve someone's overincome or overcontrol.
It is manipulation. Personally I'd prefer Metro UI to stop existing on desktop.
Or have legal possibility of installing software from the side.
At least on PC platform.
Like in Android - if you want to install apps not from their store - you can.
Android is based on linux and continues to bring its freedom while MS and Apple take it away.
